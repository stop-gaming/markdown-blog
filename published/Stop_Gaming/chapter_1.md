# Preface

This book is written for parents who are eager to help their children quit gaming (or control the length of time they play games) and Internet addiction. It is also beneficial for players to read this book. In a while, I will present a new book to players.

Since 2018, I have begun to notice that many children have neglected their studies because of playing online games, which in turn affects the happiness of the entire family. I myself am one of the biggest victims of playing games, and very few people have suffered as deeply as I have. Countless families are looking for ways to reduce the harm of excessive gaming, but in 2025, **all books on the market are written by psychology experts, and no book is written by players who have successfully quit gaming**.

At the same time, these books are not specifically for quitting gaming. These books guide parents on how to communicate effectively with their children, but do not provide a plan to guide players to quit gaming. It seems that once parents communicate, the problem of children's Internet addiction will be solved. After reading these books, I found that none of them could help me when I was addicted to games - whether it was controlling the time spent playing games or quitting games, these books were not very effective.

**Only those who have experienced game addiction and successfully quit can write the best way to quit video games, because they can fully understand the psychology of players and design a withdrawal (or control the game time) plan from the perspective of players to make it truly effective!**

This book provides a simple and easy solution to quit games - **Zhang Jian's "Smart Reading" Game Quitting Method**. As long as parents and children operate it, it is not difficult for players to quit games or play only a small number of games in the end!

**The "Smart Reading" method can also be used for interventions in other Internet addictions, such as short videos, online novels, chasing dramas, anime, etc. You only need to replace "games" in the following text with the items you want to control.**

# Scientific Game Quitting Method

I am Zhang Jian, a former "senior" game player who was addicted to games for six years. After thousands of "swearing" attempts to control the time spent playing games and failing, I finally quit games completely after a rational review.

I don’t want to write a long article and wait for readers to finish reading tens of thousands of words before explaining how I did it. But I also don’t want readers to ignore it because they know the answer too easily. In fact, I went through a lot of hardships to quit games. It can be said that I almost lost my life!

Why is it so difficult to quit games? The reason is **players love playing games!**

If you want to quit, players have to fight against the dual pressure of physical and psychological pressure. Therefore, it is almost impossible to force players to leave the game for a long time. It must rely on the players’ self-awakening, sow the seeds in their hearts that playing games will harm themselves, and finally turn their love for games into hatred, and gradually fall in love with a healthy real life.

The scientific and easy way to quit games is:

- **(“害”) Realize the harm of games.**
- **(“伊” means “意”) It is easy to fail to fight games with “willpower”, but you still need to strengthen “willpower”.**
- **(“只” means “智”) Rely on “think tanks” to implement “heteronomy”.**
- **(“戒”) It is best to quit video games completely right now.**
- **(“一”) If you can’t make up your mind to quit, just play a little bit of games – quit for a month first, then play less than four hours a week.**
- **(“季” is the same as “计”) If playing just a few games is not possible, play games “according to the plan”.**
- **(“度” is the same as “读”) Cultivate your body and mind by “reading more, making more money, and dating”, and eventually change your love for games to fear and quit games (or play only a few games).**

The above seven lines represent seven actions, each of which is represented by a shorthand word, and together they are “**害伊只戒一季**”. The following will introduce these seven actions in detail.

# Understand the harm of games

Players must have enough knowledge of the harm of games. If they can't do this, they can't quit playing games! Playing games is harmful to players in all aspects, including "physical, mental, family, social, academic, and career". Zhang Jian made up his mind to quit playing games after evaluating the pros and cons of playing games, and found that the disadvantages of playing games far outweighed the benefits of playing games. If you don't quit, you're a fool! There is a chapter below called "Analysis of the pros and cons of playing games". Players are requested to fill it out and evaluate it when reading this chapter.

**When players have enough knowledge of the harm of games, they will have enough fear and hatred for games. These two emotions will affect their actions, and people will spontaneously stay away from games, which is equivalent to strengthening "self-discipline". Therefore, players should work hard on their thoughts and try their best to dig out the harm of games.**

**When you think of games, you habitually turn to thinking about the harm of games, or directly move your thoughts away from games. This is the method of working hard on "self-discipline", which is called "the method of realizing the harm of games".**

Before knowing the correct way to study, the player just suppresses the desire to play games. In essence, he still does not see through the game and still thinks that the game is a good thing.

After knowing the correct way to study, the player develops a fear of games from the mind, and gradually no longer thinks that games are a good thing. He does not need to suppress his heart, and naturally, the game is thrown into the trash. In the end, it is effortless to quit the game.

Think about it, **If the player really regards electronic games as a scourge, will he still play?**


Wang Yangming said: "He who wins easily is a great sage." This is the truth.
