## Key 'permalink'

### When 'permalink' is Empty, '/', or Invalid
If the `permalink` value is empty, `/`, or invalid, we will automatically generate a `permalink` based on the value of `title`.

For example, if the title is `This is an Example Post`, the corresponding permalink will be `this-is-an-example-post`.
Spaces are replaced with `-`, illegal characters will be deleted, and all lowercase letters are used.

Next time you modify the `title`, the value of `permalink` will also change accordingly.

### You can modify the 'permalink' at any time without worrying about SEO weight of the post being reduced.

That's because we append a `-` and a number to the end of each post link.
So for this post, the real path would be like `your-domain.com/this-is-an-example-post-1472`.

Visiting a stale URL will be redirected to the fresh URL with status 301.

## How to add pictures to your posts?

Remember to put the images in the [/images](/images) directory. The blog **cannot** recognize other directories as image directory!

For referencing an image, it is completely Markdown syntax.
